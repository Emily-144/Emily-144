# Hello, World! &#128075;

### I'm Emily Gross, or Emily-144! (Haha, puns)  

&#127891; I am a CS & Mathematics student!  
&#129300; I'm interested in everything tech!  
&#128221; I am currently learning Java in my studies, but also love to experiment (learning Python, SQL, and Linux in my free time)  
&#128170; I strive to always be learning and expanding on my skills :)  
&#128236; I will be open to new opportunities after Summer 2024; you can contact me through any of the platforms below   
&#9999; Please note that I cannot upload projects I've completed at school for copyright reasons. Feel free to ask me about them though!

#### Have a great day!
