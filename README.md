# Hello, World! &#128075;

### I'm Emily Gross, or Emily-144! (Haha, puns)  

&#127891; I am a CS & Mathematics student!  
&#129300; I'm interested in everything tech!  
&#128221; Currently using C and Python in school, but I first learned programming with Swift and Java  
&#128170; I strive to always be learning and expanding on my skills :)   
&#9999; I can't publicly upload school projects for copyright reasons, but feel free to ask me about them!

#### Have a great day!
